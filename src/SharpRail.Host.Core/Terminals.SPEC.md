# Terminals — host-owned PTY sessions

Upstream: packages/server/src/terminal/SPEC.md @ 12830b08

## Responsibility

Host-owned shells rooted in a workspace, one per terminal tab, and the recent output replayed when a
client attaches. A shell outlives every client that shows it. `PtyTerminalService` implements
`ITerminalService`; each attachment is an `ITerminalSession`. Clients are opaque ids; which window places
a tab where is frontend-local and never reaches this service.

## Boundary

- Owns: the session table keyed by session id, the PTY (`PtySession`: `posix_openpt`, `posix_spawn` of
  the shell as a new session leader, a wait thread and a read pump), exclusive attachment with takeover
  (`HostedTerminal`), the output recorder (`TerminalRecorder`) and foreground-process detection.
- Public surface: `AttachAsync`, `IsBusyAsync`, `CloseAsync`, `DisposeAsync`; `TerminalDevice` for the
  relay's raw mode and window size.
- Forbidden: UI and transport types. Output reaches clients only through the attachment they hold.

## Decisions

- Shell selection: an existing `SHELL` wins, else `/bin/zsh` on macOS, else `/bin/sh`. It starts as a
  login shell (`-l`) in the workspace root, matching Terminal.app; the PTY supplies interactivity. The
  environment is the host's minus `SHARPRAIL_TOKEN`, with 256-colour/truecolour `TERM` and a UTF-8 locale
  when none is set. POSIX only; other platforms show an availability message.
- A shell is keyed by a stable session id the client derives from workspace and tab, never by a
  connection or a view. Attach is get-or-create under one lock, so concurrent attaches never start two
  shells. A resume (`Offset >= 0`) never starts a shell: a session that no longer exists is an error.
- Ownership is the host's, not a window's. Any client may attach; attach is exclusive with takeover.
  A PTY has one size, so the new attachment becomes the recipient and the previous one completes
  `Detached`. Only the current attachment may write, resize or kill; a displaced client's input is
  ignored and it is told again that it is detached. A resuming client that lost the session to another
  client receives a detached attachment and never takes the session back; reclaiming is an explicit
  gesture ("Take it back").
- A shell ends for exactly four reasons: its tab is closed (`CloseAsync`), it exits, the host stops, or
  a client kills it. Detaching, closing a window or dropping a connection kills nothing. There is no idle
  culling and no abandoned-client reap. A shell that exits while detached keeps its final output and exit
  status for the next attach; the exit code is the shell's, or 128 plus the terminating signal.
- Busy means a process other than the shell owns the terminal's foreground process group (`tcgetpgrp`);
  a builtin running in the shell itself reads as idle. Closing a busy tab asks first; an idle tab closes
  immediately.
- Killing sends SIGHUP to the shell's process group, then SIGKILL if it does not exit.
- Not tmux: no extra dependency, no competing tab model.

## Replay

- A fresh view receives a bounded snapshot (64 KiB) of the main screen: raw bytes, never the alternate
  screen (tracked as a stream, since a switch can split across reads), never a mode sequence itself,
  preceded by a reset and the last observed private modes other than mouse tracking. Resize events are
  never replayed.
- A resuming client receives exactly the bytes after its position while the 1 MiB resume window still
  holds them, else a fresh snapshot. Replay and the switch to live output happen under the output lock,
  so every byte reaches an attachment exactly once.
- Grid updates are change-only. A fresh view on an unchanged grid still needs the foreground program to
  repaint, and resizing to the same size sends no SIGWINCH, so attach narrows the grid by one column and
  restores it 50 ms later — not in the same tick, which a full-screen program would observe as no change
  and repaint incrementally over a stale buffer. The restore is skipped when the shell exited or a real
  resize landed meanwhile.

## Not yet ported

- A persisted per-workspace terminal catalog (at most 256 tabs, bounded keys and titles) shared by every
  client, with reservation separate from attachment so a hidden default terminal survives reload and
  other clients without a shell, and catalog membership broadcast on change.
- Revival across a host restart: persisting recordings at stop and restoring tabs whose first attach
  starts a fresh shell showing the old picture; a failed spawn keeps the pending recording.
- Closing every terminal of a removed workspace.
- Stable, non-native guidance when a shell cannot start, and Windows shells (PowerShell / cmd selection).
- A bounded child-process runner: completion on the child's exit rather than pipe EOF (a grandchild
  holding the pipes must not turn success into a timeout), a drain grace after the deadline race is
  decided, process-group kill on expiry only, clamped budgets, stdin closed, both streams read from spawn,
  and the live environment rather than a launch-time snapshot.
